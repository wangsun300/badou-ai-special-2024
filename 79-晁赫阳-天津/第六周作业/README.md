# Week 6 Homework Programs
This repository contains the implementation for a program as part of the sixth week's homework assignment.

Programs Included:
## K-Means Clustering Implementation
This program demonstrates how to perform K-Means clustering on an image using OpenCV. The K-Means algorithm is used to segment an image into different clusters based on pixel values. The program can handle both color and grayscale images, converting them into a format suitable for clustering and then applying the K-Means algorithm to generate the segmented image.
