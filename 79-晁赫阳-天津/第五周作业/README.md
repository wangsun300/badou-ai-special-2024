# Week 5 Homework Programs
This repository contains implementations for two programs as part of the fifth week's homework assignment.

Programs Included:
## Perspective Transformation Implementation
This program demonstrates how to perform perspective transformation using OpenCV. Perspective transformation is used to convert an image from one viewpoint to another. 
You need to provide the coordinates of four points in the original image, representing the four corners of the region to be transformed, as well as the corresponding positions
of these points in the target image. OpenCV's cv2.getPerspectiveTransform() function is used to compute the transformation matrix and apply it to the image.

## Canny Edge Detection Implementation
This program implements Canny edge detection, a popular edge detection algorithm that uses gradient magnitudes to detect edges within an image. 
The Canny edge detection algorithm is widely used in image processing tasks for its effectiveness in identifying sharp changes in intensity.
