# Week 7 Homework Programs
This repository contains implementations for multiple programs as part of the seventh week's homework assignment.

Programs Included:
## Hierarchical and Density-Based Clustering Implementation
This program demonstrates how to perform hierarchical clustering and density-based clustering (DBSCAN) using the Iris dataset. 
Hierarchical clustering builds a tree of clusters by repeatedly merging or splitting existing clusters, while DBSCAN groups together 
points that are closely packed and marks points that are far away as outliers.

## SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) Implementation
This program implements the SIFT algorithm to detect and describe local features in images. The SIFT algorithm is used for object 
recognition, image stitching, and 3D reconstruction. The code includes detecting keypoints, computing descriptors, and matching features
between two images.
